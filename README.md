# Anomaly detection in histopathology
Repository for Anomaly Detection department of Case Studies II at Warsaw University of Technology. Our task was to detect anomalies in histopathological data from PCAM dataset. Our approach was to treat cancer as anomaly, thus the problem turned into detecting tumour tissues.

## My contribution

Me and Tomasz were responsible for unsupervised anomaly detection using GANs. We decided to use [f-AnoGAN framework](https://github.com/A03ki/f-AnoGAN) implemented by [A03ki](https://github.com/A03ki). We made essential modifications to make it work with PCAM dataset and to train networks only on normal (healthy) data. We also utilized [StainNet](https://github.com/khtao/StainNet) network to stain normalize our images. 

Unfortunately, we were limited by hardware. While training GANs on such a large amount of data is computationally demanding, we could only train it a few times for a relatively small number of epochs. However, the results were not that bad. After testing our network on unseen images, we obtained an anomaly score for each image. Using this score, we determined the optimal cut-off point for binary classification (distinguishing between images containing tumor tissue and those that do not). We achieved an impressive recall of 0.952 and a reasonably good accuracy of 0.632.
